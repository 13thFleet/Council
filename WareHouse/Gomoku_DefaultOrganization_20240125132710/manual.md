## Game Rules <a name="game-rules"></a>

Gomoku is a strategy board game played on a 15x15 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to get five of their pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game is played by two players, Black and White, who take turns placing their pieces on the board. Black always goes first.

## How to Play <a name="how-to-play"></a>

1. When the game window opens, you will see a 15x15 grid representing the game board.

2. To make a move, click on an empty cell on the board. The cell will be filled with your piece (Black or White).

3. The game will automatically switch turns between Black and White after each move.

4. The first player to get five of their pieces in a row wins the game. If the board is filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## Game Controls <a name="game-controls"></a>

The game controls are simple:

- Left-click: Place a piece on the board.

## Ending the Game <a name="ending-the-game"></a>

The game will automatically end when one player wins by getting five of their pieces in a row, or when the board is filled and no player has won.

To play again, simply close the game window and run the `main.py` file again.

Enjoy playing Gomoku!
